## Features

### Record with Effects
Unlike typical voice recorders, 1Take applies EQ, Compressor, Noise Gate, and Limiter in real-time. Your recordings sound polished right out of the app.

### Three Presets
- **Studio**: Clean recording with gentle compression for acoustic instruments and vocals
- **Studio+**: Solid compression for dynamic performances  
- **Live**: Noise gate reduces background noise between playing

### Pre-roll Recording
Never miss the beginning of a great take. Pre-roll continuously buffers audio, so when you hit record, the previous seconds are automatically included.

### Professional Metering
- VU meter shows average levels
- Tap to switch to GR (Gain Reduction) meter
- Peak indicator with reset function

## FAQ

### How do I start recording?
1. Select a preset (Studio, Studio+, or Live)
2. Tap the red record button
3. Tap again to stop and save

### What is Pre-roll?
Pre-roll captures audio before you press record. If you enable 5-second pre-roll and press record after a great guitar riff, those 5 seconds are automatically included.

### How do I access my recordings?
Your recordings are saved automatically and can be found in the Recordings tab. They are also accessible via the Files app.

### What does the GR meter show?
The GR (Gain Reduction) meter shows how much compression is being applied. Tap the VU meter to switch to GR display.
