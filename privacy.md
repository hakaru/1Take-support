# Privacy Policy

**Last updated: January 19, 2026**

## Introduction

1Take ("we", "our", or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our iOS application.

## Information We Collect

### We Do NOT Collect Personal Data

1Take is designed with privacy in mind. The app:

- **Does not collect** any personal information
- **Does not require** user registration or account creation
- **Does not track** your usage or behavior

- **Does not share** any data with third parties

### Local Data Only

All data created by the app, including:

- Audio recordings
- Recording metadata (date, duration, markers)
- App settings and preferences

is stored **locally on your device only**. This data never leaves your device unless you explicitly choose to share or export it.

## Microphone Access

1Take requires microphone access to record audio. This permission is used solely for the purpose of recording when you actively press the record button. We do not:

- Record audio without your knowledge
- Access the microphone when the app is not in use
- Transmit audio data to any server

## Data Storage

All recordings and settings are stored locally on your device in the app's private storage area. You can access your recordings through the iOS Files app if file sharing is enabled.

## Data Deletion

You can delete your recordings at any time through the app's Recordings tab. Uninstalling the app will remove all associated data from your device.

## Third-Party Services

1Take does not integrate with any third-party services, analytics platforms, or advertising networks.

## Children's Privacy

1Take does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13.
