## Introduction

When recording on iPhone, you probably open "Voice Memos." But let me be honest. Have you ever thought the sound from Voice Memos was musically "good"?

- "Recorded at loud studio volume, came back distorted and unlistenable"
- "Volume keeps fluctuating on its own (that's AGC), ruining the performance dynamics"
- "Recorded dozens of takes, but finding the best one takes all day"

I've experienced that despair countless times myself. With the obsession that "iPhone's potential must be more than this...!", I developed **"1Take"**—by a musician, for musicians!

## Motivation: Why Build a "Recorder" from Scratch?

In this age where smartphones can do everything, there's still a huge gap between "recording" and "expression."

For those using dedicated hardware recorders (ZOOM, TASCAM—you know, that thing in your gear bag), **"gain control, EQ, compression" are a given.** Without them, pressing the record button feels scary.

**"iPhone's built-in Voice Memos is just not musical."**

That says it all. So why not rebuild what's inside the iPhone with the same philosophy as pro gear? That's the "gear nerd's pride" packed into 1Take.

## What Makes It "Music-Dedicated"! 1Take's Obsessive Details

### 1. Pro-Grade Signal Processing Chain

1Take's internals are essentially a tiny recording studio. Input audio passes through these processes in **real-time**:

- **Input Trim**: Digital gain to secure proper volume first.
- **Noise Gate**: Cuts hiss between playing and AC noise from rehearsal studios.
- **4-Band EQ**: Musical corrections like "cut low-end mud, add air to highs."
- **2-Stage Compressor**: This is the key. Comp A catches quick peaks, Comp B adds density and fattens the sound. Just this gets you close to that "CD sound" quality the moment you record.
- **Maximizer**: Iron-clad guard against digital clipping at the final stage. Focus on playing with peace of mind.

### 2. Presets Recreating "Those Legendary Units"

Don't worry if you don't understand complicated parameters (threshold, ratio, etc.). We prepared presets modeled after legendary gear that made music history.

- **Studio (LA-2A style)**: For vocals and acoustic guitar. Tube-like warmth and smooth compression that feels incredible.
- **Studio+ (1176 style)**: For drums and electric guitar. Punchy, aggressive sound that hits hard.
- **Live (VCA style)**: For live shows and loud rehearsals. Aimed for clear, stable sound that "won't fall apart."

### 3. Features Solving Musicians' Common Problems

- **Pre-roll Recording**: Even if you press record after thinking "That take was amazing!", it saves data from seconds before (up to 30 seconds!). No more holding your head thinking "I forgot to hit record!"
- **Analog-Style VU Meter**: Recreated that "needle" movement with careful 300ms time constant. Grasp volume intuitively, not through numbers.
- **Clip Guard & Markers**: Instant warning if audio clips during recording. Plus auto "CLIP markers" so you can find "fix this part only" spots in seconds.

## For the Serious: "Pro Features" with God-Level DAW Integration

From version 1.1.0, we're adding support for the professional format **BWF (Broadcast Wave Format)** (in development).

What's amazing about this is that recording data embeds metadata of "when it was recorded." Drop it into DaVinci Resolve or Logic Pro, and **files automatically align to the correct recording time position.** No more struggling with "wait, which video does this audio go with?" during sync work.

## Finally: To Focus on the Performance Itself

1Take was built to use technology to eliminate "the anxiety of failed recordings."

**Spend less time touching your phone, more time touching your instrument.**

Make your iPhone not just a smartphone, but an essential "ultimate partner (recorder)" for your music activities.

First, be amazed by the "difference in sound" with the free version. Want to record your next studio practice with 1Take?
