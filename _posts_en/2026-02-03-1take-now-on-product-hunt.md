## What is 1Take?

1Take is a professional audio recording app designed for musicians. It solves a simple but frustrating problem: losing the beginning of great takes.

With Pre-roll recording, 1Take continuously buffers audio so when you hit record, it captures what happened *before* you pressed the button. No more missing those spontaneous musical moments.

## Key Features

- **Pre-roll Recording** - Never miss the start of a great take
- **Professional Signal Chain** - EQ, Compressor, Gate, and Limiter built-in
- **Three Presets** - Studio (LA-2A style), Studio+ (1176 style), Live (VCA style)
- **Recording Analysis** - Automatic quality assessment with LUFS metering
- **No Account Required** - Just record and go
